    """Load trajectories (or time-series) of border cell clusters.

    The marker used for imaging is a GFP tagged marker of F-actin markers.

    Notes
    -----
    There are 25 images (frames) per .tif video.
    There are 16 videos (trajectories).

    In each movie, there is a group of cells called the "border cell cluster", i.e.
    a tightly packed group of 5-7 cells that coordinate their movement as they move.
    They look (and in many ways behave) as a single cell. They move within
    a large structure, the egg chamber: we say that they "migrate".

    At some point in their migration, the cluster shows has a "lead protrusion"
    and sometimes the cluster is compact and lack this protrusion.

    The movies from this dataset, i.e. labeled 33623, 59080, and 104438 are actually of
    single cells (one cell within the cluster) or sometimes two cells in the cluster
    labeled with the rest of the cells in the cluster being dark.

    The movies labeled "33623" represents the control case, and shows a single cell as
    the rest of the cells in the cluster are dark.

    The movies labeled "59080" and "104438" correspond to knockdowns of proteins,
    where we anticipate the following shape changes:
    - cells less cohesive,
    - producing very small thin protrusions.
